## Project Structure

- `/memory/` - Project constitution and governance
- `/specs/` - Feature specifications and requirements
- `/templates/` - Spec-driven development templates
- `/scripts/` - Automation scripts for workflow

## Spec-Driven Development Workflow

1. **Constitution** - Establish project principles
2. **Specify** - Define feature requirements
3. **Plan** - Create technical implementation strategy
4. **Tasks** - Break down into actionable items
5. **Implement** - Execute the plan

## Integration with KIS_CORE_V2

This project uses Spec-Driven Development to enhance the existing KIS industrial software system with AI capabilities while maintaining high quality and security standards.
