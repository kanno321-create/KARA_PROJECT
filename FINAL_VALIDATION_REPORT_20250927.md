## ⚠️ Issues & Recommendations

### 🔧 Identified Issues (Non-Blocking for Production)

#### 1. SSE/WebSocket Test Timeouts (Medium Priority)
- **Impact:** Real-time communication features not fully validated
- **Root Cause:** LiveJsonlSink directory creation blocking during tests
- **Evidence:** Timeout in `test_events_sse.py`, `test_events_ws.py`, `test_sse_minimal.py`
- **Recommendation:** Fix test infrastructure before production deployment

#### 2. Events Contract Path Resolution (Low Priority)
- **Impact:** Event schema validation incomplete (3 test failures)
- **Root Cause:** Incorrect relative path to `spec/openapi.yaml` in test
- **Evidence:** `test_events_contract_examples_match.py` failures
- **Recommendation:** Update test path resolution for complete contract validation

### 📋 Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] **Immediate:** Fix SSE/WebSocket test infrastructure
- [ ] **Immediate:** Resolve events contract test path issues
- [ ] **Before Production:** Performance testing under load
- [ ] **Before Production:** Production monitoring setup
- [ ] **Ongoing:** Continuous integration configuration
