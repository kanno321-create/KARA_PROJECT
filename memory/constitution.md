# KIS_CORE_V2 Project Constitution

## Project Identity
**Project Name**: KIS_CORE_V2  
**Purpose**: Korean Industrial Software Core Version 2 - Advanced industrial software system with AI integration  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Ratification Date**: 2025-09-22  
**Last Amended**: 2025-09-22  

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Code Quality Excellence
All code must meet high standards of readability, maintainability, and performance. This includes comprehensive testing, clear documentation, and adherence to established coding standards. Code reviews are mandatory before merging.

**Rationale**: Industrial software requires reliability and maintainability for long-term success.

### Principle 2: Security First
Security considerations must be integrated into every aspect of development. This includes secure coding practices, regular security assessments, and protection of sensitive data.

**Rationale**: Industrial systems often handle critical data and operations requiring maximum security.

### Principle 3: Performance Optimization
System performance must be continuously monitored and optimized. Resource efficiency and scalability are core requirements for all components.

**Rationale**: Industrial applications require optimal performance for real-time operations.

### Principle 4: User Experience Consistency
All user interfaces must provide consistent, intuitive experiences. Design patterns and interaction models should be standardized across the system.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces training time and user errors in industrial environments.

### Principle 5: AI Integration Standards
AI components must be implemented with transparency, explainability, and fail-safe mechanisms. AI decisions should be auditable and reversible.

**Rationale**: AI in industrial settings requires human oversight and accountability.
